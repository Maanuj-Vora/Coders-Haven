# Operators

---

Operators are used in many scenarios. Note that there are two types of operators

- Logic Operators
- Mathematical Operators

### Logic Operators

- Used for comparisions between two or more objects

### Mathematical Operators

- Used for mathematical operations

---

## Examples of Logic Operators

- '==' (Checking if two things are equal)
- '!=' (Checking if two things are not equal)
- '>' (Checking if the first object is greater than the second object)
- '<' (Checking if the first object is less than the second object)
- '>=' (Checking if the first object is greater than or equal to the first object)
- '<=' (Checking if the first object is less than or equal to the first object)
- '||' (If this is true or that is true, then the whole thing is true) (Only in If Statement)
- '&&' (This and that have to be true for the whole thing to be true) (Only in If Statement)
- 'and' (If this is true or that is true, then the whole thing is true)
- 'or' (This and that have to be true for the whole thing to be true)

## Examples of Mathematical Operators

- '+' (Adding two items)
- '-' (Subtracting two items)
- '\*' (Multiplying two items)
- '/' (Dividing two items)
- '%' (Modulus(Basically remainder))
