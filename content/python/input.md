# Input

---

The input() function will pose a prompt to the user, in which the answer to the question will be returned to the program

Remember that all responses will be stored in a string even if they are numbers, so use casting!

Example

> input("What is your name?")
>
> > "Maanuj"

> input("What is your age?")
>
> > "17"

> input("Are you alive?")
>
> > "False"
