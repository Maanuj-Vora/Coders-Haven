# If Statements

---

If Statements are composed of some parts

---

> if(condition):
>
> > code
>
> elif(condition):
>
> > code
>
> else:
>
> > code

---

## Breaking it down

- if -> if
  - needs a condition
- elif -> else if
  - needs a conditions
  - the second condition
  - you can have as many of these as you want
- else -> else
  - does not need a condition

---

### There are 3 Rules

1. NEVER, NEVER EVER, call a If Statment an If Loop
2. The conditions will almost always use operators
3. The conditions have to be true for a block of code to execute

## Examples

> x = 4
>
> if(x < 5):
>
> > print("James is super smart")
>
> elif(x == 6):
>
> > print("The smartest boi in the world is currently traveling")
>
> else:
>
> > print("James is a smartie")
