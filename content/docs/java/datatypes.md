# Datatypes

---

We will be exploring different datatypes

---

1. Integer - int
2. Double - double
3. Boolean - boolean
4. String - String

---

## Integer

* Any whole number

## Double

* Any number with a decimal

## Boolean

* True or False

## String

* Any letters, numbers, and characters
* Quotation marks are needed around the value

---

### Integer

Integers are usually defined as so, 

``` java
int x = 12;
```

This is showing that the value of zero is being assigned to the integer variable called x.

ints can only store integers.

---

### Double

Doubles are usually defined as so, 

``` java
double y = 2.1;
```

This is showing that the value of 2.1 is being assigned to the double called y.

doubles can store both integers, and numbers with decimals, but it will convert an integer to a double

---

### Booleans

Booleans are usually defined as so, 

``` java
boolean z = true;
```

Booleans can only equal to true or false.

---

### Strings

Strings are basically words that can be stored as a variable. To define one, you would write, 

``` java
String a = "You would need to use quotes to write a string";
```

Strings can contain words and numbers.

---

### Extra

You can print out a variable too.

``` java
System.out.println(x);
```

This statement would print out the value of x, which is `0`

``` java
System.out.println(y);
```

If you replaced the x with y, it would now print out the value `2.1`

``` java
System.out.println(z);
```

If you then replaced the y with z, it would then print out the value `true`

``` java
System.out.println(a);
```

And finally, if you were to replace the z with a, then it would print out, `"You would need to use quotes to write a string"` , since that is the sentence defined in the string a
