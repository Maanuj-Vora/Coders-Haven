# Hello World

---

We will be printing out the sentence 'Hello World'

---

``` java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

---

## Parts

* `public class HelloWorld {`
    - We defined a public class named `HelloWorld` . We will get to classes later
* `public static void main(String[] args) {`
    - We wrote out, public static void main(String[] args), which is a declaration in which we will later go into in detail
* `System.out.println("Hello World");`
    - Is a common way to print out phrases. To print out phrases, they need to be in quotes
* `{ }`
    - The curly brackets, { }, are used to define what is in a function.
* `;`
    - After each line of code that is not declaring a class or a main, we usually put a semi-colon(;) after it
