# Loops

---

What are loops? Loops are used for doing a task a specific number of time, but it also has other uses which we will be exploring below and later on

---

## Types of Loops

There are two types of loops that we will be introducing here

* For Loops
* While Loops

## For Loops

Usually, `for loops` are used for iterating over a sequence of objects

Here is an example in which we see that we have a list and we use the for loop to print out items in the list one by one

``` python
team = ['Pichu', 'Pikachu', 'Raichu']
for pokemon in team:
    print(pokemon)
```

This will result in the following being printed out to console

```
Pichu
Pikachu
Raichu
```
